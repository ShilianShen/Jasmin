## Para_CK: Parameter Checking

The types of condition checks are:

* Pre Condition: Conditions required to call the function. The condition checks are written inside the function. "Failing to meet preconditions" is not considered an "error".
* Req Condition: Conditions required to call the function. "Failing to meet required conditions" is considered an "error" and will output an error message.
* Opt Condition: Detailed conditions of the function. "Failing to meet optional conditions" is not considered an "error", and default values will be filled in instead.
